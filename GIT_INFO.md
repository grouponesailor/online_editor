# Git Information for WebContainer Environment

## Current Limitation
Git is not available in the WebContainer environment. This is a system constraint that cannot be changed.

## Alternative Approaches

### 1. Local Development
If you need Git functionality, you should:
- Download this project to your local machine
- Use a local development environment where Git is available
- Run `git branch` and other Git commands locally

### 2. Version Tracking Alternative
If you need to track versions within the application, consider:
- Using localStorage to store version information
- Implementing a simple versioning system in the application
- Using the browser's built-in storage APIs

### 3. Current Project State
This collaborative document editor project includes:
- Real-time collaboration features
- Document management
- File operations
- Network configuration
- Offline/online modes

## Recommended Workflow
1. Develop and test in this WebContainer environment
2. Export/download the project when ready
3. Use Git commands in your local development environment
4. Deploy using traditional Git workflows

## Note
The project is fully functional without Git - all the collaborative editing, document management, and file operations work independently of version control.
